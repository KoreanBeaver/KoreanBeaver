# üí´ About Me:
A dedicated IT professional with four years of experience in IT infrastructure, hardware and software troubleshooting, and customer support. My background in sales and product planning has strengthened my ability to communicate effectively with vendors and clients, while my military service has instilled strong teamwork and leadership skills.

Currently transitioning into the field of data technology, analysis, and engineering, I am actively pursuing relevant studies and working on personal projects to enhance my data analysis expertise. Leveraging my IT background, I aim to bridge technical proficiency with analytical problem-solving.

My goal is to complete my data-related studies and secure an entry-level or Apprenticeship role in Data Analysis, where I can apply my technical knowledge and analytical skills to drive meaningful insights. I am eager to learn, grow, and contribute to real-world projects that enhance business decision-making and operational efficiency.
